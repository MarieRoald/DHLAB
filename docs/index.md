# Welcome to the dhlab reference documentation

This site documents the [code reference](./reference.md) for the [dhlab python library](https://pypi.org/project/dhlab/) functionalities.
It is built directly from docstrings in our code library, and so the functionality documented here will reflect the [code base on GitHub](https://github.com/NationalLibraryOfNorway/DHLAB).

Head to our [official homepage](https://www.nb.no/dh-lab/) for tutorials, how-to-guides, interactive web apps, and more information about the DH-lab group.
